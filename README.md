# Hello World
Nothing to see here just yet. (:

# Instructions to use
Install a version 1.20.2 Minecraft server (other versions of MC might work).  I downloaded my server from [minecraftversions.net](https://www.minecraftversions.net/paper).

You may use the instructions @ [PaperMC.io](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/getting-started) to help you install the server correctly.

Once the server is set up, place skript inside the `*/plugins` folder.  Skript will create a new `*/scripts` folder, and place any `*.sk` files from this repo into that folder.  They will need to be reloaded with either a server restart or having an admin run `/sk reload all` (or reloading the files individually) :3
